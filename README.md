## Technical choices:

### **Project creation:**
  
 This project was built using ReactJS and framework NextJS, version 13 and new features.


### **Architecture**

 The project was divided in a way that it could be easily scalable.
 Each component or page has a folder with its respective style file.


### **Styles:**

 For project styling, the Sass pre-processor was used.
 I think Sass is very performant, makes the code more organized and allows cascading styling.


### **Code styling:**

  For pattern of project's code, I used eslint and prettier libraries, so that coding rules and patterns could be implemented.


### **Main technologies used in the project:**

* [NextJS](https://nextjs.org)
* [TypesCript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com)
